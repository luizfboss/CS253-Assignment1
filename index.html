            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science Major and Data Science Minor at Illinois Wesleryan University.
                I have been learning about technology-related topics since 2020 with an emphasis in Web Development.
                <br>
                Throughout my studies, I have been able to create applications for local businesses in my home 
                country, Brazil, and I have just started working on a mobile app for a startup! 
            </p>

            <h2 id="projects">My Projects</h2>
            <p>
                As I learn new technologies, I start building some self-driven and class-driven projects to put my knowledge into practice.
                They vary from simple Web Applications to a model that is able to solve text-based CAPTCHAs using a series of steps. All of them are posted on GitHub!
